        <p>This is a just a very minimalistic theme boiler that gets you started with Laravel Mix for building your
            project assets.</p>

        <h2>Why use Laravel Mix?</h2>

        <p>Simply put, it is a very straight-forward and easy to use wrapper for webpack that removes the need for
            a lot of the configuration that we would normally have to go through when using alternatives.</p>

        <p>For a sense of how simple it is to set up, check out the webpack.mix.js file in the them root.</p>
